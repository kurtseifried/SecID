# SecID Future Vision: AI-Native Security Knowledge Infrastructure

> **This document explores where SecID could go.** These are possibilities, not commitments. We're sharing this vision to spark discussion and invite collaboration.

---

## The Big Picture

SecID starts as an identifier scheme. But identifiers are just the foundation.

**The vision**: SecID becomes the identity layer for a federated, AI-native security knowledge graph where:

- **Anyone can contribute** - Public registries, organizational overlays, personal research
- **Multiple perspectives coexist** - Disagreements are data, not errors
- **AI is a first-class participant** - Not just consuming knowledge, but building it

---

## Three Principles

Everything follows from these:

1. **Stable identifiers** - PURL grammar gives us references that don't break
2. **Federated data** - Layer public, organizational, and personal knowledge
3. **Conflicts are features** - Different contexts produce different truths; preserve both

---

## What SecID Provides Today

Stable, canonical identifiers for security knowledge:

```
secid:advisory/mitre/cve#CVE-2024-1234
secid:weakness/mitre/cwe#CWE-79
secid:control/nist/800-53@r5#AC-1
secid:ttp/mitre/attack#T1059.003
```

**Current capability**: Given an identifier, resolve to URL(s) where the resource lives.

This is useful. But it's just the beginning.

---

## The Evolution: Federated Knowledge

### Multiple Sources, One Identifier

The same SecID can resolve against multiple data sources:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     SecID Identifier                        │
│           secid:entity/glossary/model-context-protocol      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
          ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
          ▼                 ▼                 ▼
    ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐
    │  Public  │      │   Org    │      │ Personal │
    │ Registry │      │ Registry │      │ Registry │
    ├──────────┤      ├──────────┤      ├──────────┤
    │ canonical│      │ our risk │      │ my notes │
    │ url, desc│      │ assessment│     │ research │
    └──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘
```

### What Each Layer Contributes

| Layer | Contains | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Public** | Canonical data, URLs, shared definitions | Official docs, Wikipedia links |
| **Organization** | Your team's assessments, policies, incidents | "We rate this HIGH for our environment" |
| **Personal** | Your research, notes, discoveries | Links to conversations, repos, papers |

### Merged Response

```json
{
  "secid": "secid:entity/glossary/model-context-protocol",
  "sources": {
    "public": {
      "description": "Protocol for LLM-tool integration",
      "canonical_url": "https://modelcontextprotocol.io/"
    },
    "acme-corp": {
      "risk_level": "HIGH",
      "assessment": "Tool injection risks significant for our deployment"
    },
    "personal": {
      "notes": "Need to investigate auth layer requirements",
      "research_links": ["https://github.com/..."]
    }
  }
}
```

## The Key Insight: Conflicts Are Valuable

### The Old Way (Loses Information)

Most systems try to resolve conflicts:
- Pick one authoritative source
- Merge into single "truth"
- Hide disagreements

### The Better Way (Preserves Context)

Conflicts are **signals worth keeping**:

```json
{
  "secid": "secid:advisory/mitre/cve#CVE-2024-XXXX",
  "severity": {
    "mitre": { "score": "CRITICAL", "rationale": "Remote code execution" },
    "redhat": { "score": "MEDIUM", "rationale": "Requires NFS exposure to untrusted networks" }
  }
}
```

**Why both are valid**: MITRE scores based on worst-case. Red Hat scores based on their hardening guidelines that assume NFS isn't internet-exposed. Different threat models, different answers.

**For AI**: "There are two perspectives on severity. MITRE rates CRITICAL assuming worst-case exposure. Red Hat rates MEDIUM because their deployment guidelines limit the attack surface. Your actual risk depends on your configuration."

**For humans**: Dashboard shows both ratings with context, not a false single answer.

---

## AI as First-Class Participant

### AI Isn't Just a Consumer

In this vision, AI is:

1. **A user** - Queries the knowledge graph
2. **A contributor** - Proposes new connections
3. **A synthesizer** - Explains multiple perspectives intelligently
4. **A maintainer** - Identifies gaps, staleness, inconsistencies

### What This Enables

**Research Partner**
```
"What do we know about MCP security?"

AI traverses graph, finds:
- Your previous research (3 conversations, 1 repo)
- Organization assessment (HIGH risk)
- Related weaknesses (LLM01 - Prompt Injection)
- Gap: No mapping to ATLAS techniques yet
```

**Knowledge Builder**
```
"Based on our conversation, I propose:
- New edge: MCP → vulnerable-to → AML.T0043
- Evidence: This conversation
- Source: personal

Create this entry?"
```

**Perspective Synthesizer**
```
"This CVE has three severity ratings:
- MITRE: CRITICAL (worst-case assumption)
- Red Hat: MEDIUM (hardened deployment assumption)
- Your notes: 'Actually HIGH in our environment due to legacy configs'

Real-world risk depends on deployment context."
```

**Context Loader**
```
When you start a conversation about MCP, AI automatically loads:
- Your previous research
- Org assessments
- Related security data
- Open questions from last session
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Multiple AI agents share the knowledge graph as common ground:

- **Research Agent**: Adds findings to graph
- **Code Review Agent**: Queries graph for known issues
- **Report Writer Agent**: Synthesizes from graph

All reference the same SecIDs → coherent collaboration across agents.

---

## Knowledge Graph Integration

### SecID as Node Identity

```yaml
node:
  secid: secid:entity/glossary/model-context-protocol
  properties:
    type: protocol
    vendor: Anthropic
    status: emerging
```

### Edges Reference SecIDs

```yaml
edge:
  from: secid:entity/glossary/model-context-protocol
  to: secid:weakness/owasp/llm-top10@2.0#LLM01
  relationship: vulnerable-to
  properties:
    attack_vector: tool-injection
```

### Portable Queries

SecID becomes a **portable query** that works against any compliant knowledge graph:

```
GET secid:entity/glossary/model-context-protocol

Returns:
- All nodes tagged with this SecID (from all configured sources)
- All edges where this SecID is source or target
- Merged with provenance tracking
```

---

## Expanding What Can Be Referenced

### Concepts as Entities

General knowledge concepts get a `glossary` namespace:

```
secid:entity/glossary/model-context-protocol
secid:entity/glossary/prompt-injection
secid:entity/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation
secid:entity/glossary/agent-to-agent-protocol
```

In documentation: `[MCP](secid:entity/glossary/model-context-protocol)` - a stable link that resolves to current information.

### Definitions as Entities

Different organizations define the same terms differently. Make this explicit:

```
secid:entity/mitre/vulnerability      # MITRE's definition
secid:entity/redhat/vulnerability     # Red Hat's operational definition
secid:entity/nist/vulnerability       # NIST's definition
```

Now when someone says "vulnerability," you can ask: whose definition?

│       └──────────┘   └──────────┘   └──────────┘          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each registry is text files (YAML frontmatter + Markdown):
- **Git-friendly** - Version controlled, PR-based contributions
- **AI-readable** - Structured data with rich context
- **Human-readable** - Works in any editor, renders on GitHub

---

## Summary

**Today**: SecID is an identifier scheme with a registry.

**Tomorrow**: SecID becomes the identity layer for federated security knowledge graphs.

**The mechanism**:
1. Identifier schema (PURL grammar) ✓
2. Overlay data from multiple sources (public → org → personal)
3. Conflicts preserved as signals, not resolved away
4. AI as contributor, not just consumer

**The outcome**: AI-native security knowledge infrastructure where:
- References are stable across time and context
- Perspectives are layered and traceable
- Disagreements inform rather than confuse
- AI and humans collaborate on knowledge building
