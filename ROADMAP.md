# SecID Implementation Roadmap

**Current Version: 0.9 (Public Draft)**

This document describes what we're building, in what order, and why.

## Version 1.0 Goal: URL Resolution

**Given a SecID string, return the URL(s) where that resource can be found.**

This is the simplest useful thing SecID can do, and it's the foundation everything else builds on.

```
secid:advisory/mitre/cve#CVE-2024-1234
  → https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1234

secid:weakness/mitre/cwe#CWE-79
  → https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html

secid:control/nist/800-53@r5#AC-1
  → https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_1/home?element=AC-1
```

### Why Start Here?

URL resolution delivers immediate value with minimal complexity:

1. **Useful on day one** - People can start using SecIDs to link to security resources
2. **Tests the registry** - Every namespace must define resolution rules, validating the data model
3. **Foundation for everything else** - Relationships, overlays, and applications all need resolution
4. **Clear success criteria** - Either the URL works or it doesn't

### How Resolution Works

**Simple case (most namespaces):** String substitution. The registry file contains a URL template:

```yaml
# registry/advisory/mitre/cve.md
urls:
  lookup: "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id={id}"
```

Resolution: extract `CVE-2024-1234` from the subpath, substitute into template.

**Complex case (no direct URL):** Some resources don't have predictable URLs. For these, we provide search instructions that humans and AI agents can follow:

```yaml
# Example: a resource without direct linking
resolution:
  type: search
  instructions: "Search the vendor's security portal for the advisory ID"
  search_url: "https://example.com/security/search?q={id}"
```

## Version 1.0 Deliverables (In Priority Order)

| Priority | Deliverable | Why This Order |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **1** | **Registry data** | Foundation - libraries need data to resolve against |
| **2** | **Python library** | Security community standard; threat intel, SIEM, AI/ML pipelines |
| **3** | **npm/TypeScript library** | Web applications, CI/CD integrations, broad developer reach |
| **4** | **REST API** | Unlocks every other language without waiting for native libraries |
| **5** | **Go library** | Cloud-native security tools (Trivy, Grype, Falco), Kubernetes ecosystem |
| **6** | **Rust library** | Memory-safe systems tools, growing security tooling adoption |
| **7** | **Java library** | Enterprise SAST/DAST tools, legacy integration |
| **8** | **C#/.NET library** | Windows/enterprise ecosystem |

### Why This Order?

**Registry first** because everything depends on it. A library without data is useless.

**Python second** because the security community runs on Python. Threat intelligence platforms, SIEM integrations, vulnerability scanners, AI/ML pipelines - Python is the lingua franca.

**npm/TypeScript third** because it covers web applications and has the broadest developer reach. Security dashboards, CI/CD integrations, and developer tools often use JavaScript/TypeScript.

**REST API fourth** because it's a force multiplier. Once the API exists, any language can consume SecID - Ruby, PHP, shell scripts, anything that can make HTTP requests. This reduces pressure to ship every native library immediately.

**Go fifth** because cloud-native security infrastructure runs on Go. Tools like Trivy, Grype, and Falco would benefit from native SecID support, and Go is common for CLI tools and microservices.

**Rust, Java, C#/.NET later** because their communities can use the REST API until native libraries ship. These are important for completeness but not blockers for adoption.

## What We're Building (Full Stack)

SecID isn't just a spec - it's a complete system for working with security knowledge. We're building in **two parallel tracks**:

```
                    CONTENT TRACK                         DATA LAYERS
                    (what you get back)                   (connections & context)

```

### The Vision: AI-First Responses

A SecID isn't just an identifier - it's a handle that gives you everything you need to understand and work with that security concept. When an AI agent receives a SecID response, it should be able to:

1. **Find it** - URL or search instructions
2. **Understand it** - Description of what it is
3. **Read it** - Actual content (where licensing permits)
4. **Interpret it** - Schema, guidance on what fields mean
5. **Use it** - Instructions on what to do with this data
6. **Connect it** - Related concepts, mitigations, examples

**Example future response:**

```json
{
  "secid": "secid:control/csa/ccm@4.0#IAM-12",
  "urls": {
    "lookup": "https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/cloud-controls-matrix-v4",
    "api": "https://api.secid.dev/v1/control/csa/ccm/IAM-12"
  },
  "description": "Identity & Access Management control requiring multi-factor authentication for all interactive access to cloud services.",
  "content": {
    "raw": {
      "title": "IAM-12: Multi-Factor Authentication",
      "control_text": "Multi-factor authentication shall be implemented for all interactive access...",
      "implementation_guidance": "...",
      "audit_guidance": "..."
    },
    "license": "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
    "attribution": "Cloud Security Alliance",
    "retrieved": "2024-01-15"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "mitigates": ["secid:weakness/mitre/cwe#CWE-308", "secid:weakness/mitre/cwe#CWE-287"],
    "related_controls": ["secid:control/nist/800-53@r5#IA-2"],
    "attacked_by": ["secid:ttp/mitre/attack#T1078"]
  },
  "meta": {
    "schema": "https://secid.dev/schemas/control/v1",
    "interpretation": "This is a technical control requiring MFA. The 'control_text' field contains the normative requirement. Check 'implementation_guidance' for how to implement, 'audit_guidance' for how to verify compliance.",
    "usage": "Use this to verify MFA requirements in cloud environments. Compare against your current authentication configuration.",
    "spec": "https://secid.dev/spec",
    "api_docs": "https://secid.dev/api"
  }
}
```

This response is **self-describing** - an AI receiving it knows what it has, how to interpret it, and what to do with it. The raw content stays raw; we add context through metadata, not transformation.

## Content Track (Parallel Development)

### Phase 1: URL + Description (v1.0)

Return where to find it and what it is:

```json
{
  "secid": "secid:control/csa/ccm@4.0#IAM-12",
  "urls": { "lookup": "..." },
  "description": "Identity & Access Management control requiring multi-factor authentication..."
}
```

### Phase 2: Raw Content (v1.x)

Add actual content where licensing permits:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "raw": { "title": "...", "control_text": "...", "guidance": "..." },
    "license": "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
    "attribution": "Cloud Security Alliance"
  }
}
```

**Why this matters:** Some sources are hard to access programmatically:
- CSA CCM/AICM are in spreadsheets
- ISO standards are behind paywalls
- Vendor advisories require authentication
- Data is buried in HTML tables or nested pages

We respect licensing - include license info, proper attribution, and only redistribute what's permitted.

### Phase 3: Content Metadata (v2.x)

Wrap raw content in a JSON container with interpretation and usage guidance:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "raw": { "title": "...", "control_text": "...", "guidance": "..." },
    "license": "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
    "attribution": "Cloud Security Alliance"
  },
  "meta": {
    "schema": "https://secid.dev/schemas/control/v1",
    "interpretation": "This is a technical control requiring MFA. The 'control_text' field contains the normative requirement, 'guidance' contains implementation suggestions.",
    "usage": "Use this to verify MFA requirements in cloud environments. Compare against your current authentication configuration.",
    "spec": "https://secid.dev/spec",
    "api_docs": "https://secid.dev/api"
  }
}
```

**Why this matters:** Raw data alone isn't enough for AI agents. They need:
- Schema link to understand structure
- Interpretation guidance for what fields mean
- Usage instructions for what to do with the data
- The content stays raw - we're adding context, not transforming it

## Data Layers (Independent Track)

### Relationships (Future)

Connect SecIDs to each other: CVE → CWE weakness, weakness → control mitigation, technique → weakness exploit.

**Why independent?** Relationship design benefits from real-world usage. We can ship content before relationships are fully designed.

See [RELATIONSHIPS.md](RELATIONSHIPS.md) for exploratory thinking.

### Overlays (Future)

Add metadata without modifying sources: cross-references, quality flags, severity adjustments, organizational context.

**Why independent?** Same reason - usage will inform design. Overlays can be added to any response once the infrastructure exists.

See [OVERLAYS.md](OVERLAYS.md) for exploratory thinking.

## Registry Seeding Strategy

### Why Start with Hundreds/Thousands of Entities?

The initial seeding serves multiple purposes:

1. **Stress test the spec**: Do our naming conventions hold up? Are there edge cases we missed?

2. **Learn the landscape**: What databases exist? How do they relate? What's the coverage?

3. **Build the graph**: Relationships need entities on both ends. More entities = richer graph.

4. **Demonstrate value**: A spec with 10 examples is theoretical. A spec with 1000 entities is useful.

5. **Attract contributors**: People contribute to living projects, not empty frameworks.

### Seeding Phases

**Phase 1: Core Security Infrastructure (50-100 entities)**

The foundations everything else references:

| Category | Examples | Why First |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Vuln databases | CVE, NVD, GHSA, OSV, CNVD, EUVD | Core references |
| Weakness taxonomies | CWE, OWASP Top 10 | Vulnerability classification |
| Attack frameworks | ATT&CK, ATLAS, CAPEC | Threat modeling |
| Scoring systems | CVSS, EPSS | Severity/priority |
| Organizations | MITRE, NIST, FIRST, OWASP | Governance/authority |

*Status: Largely complete in current files*

**Phase 2: AI/ML Security Ecosystem (100-200 entities)**

Deep coverage of AI security landscape:

| Category | Examples | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| AI vendors | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta | Products to track |
| AI products | GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama | Vulnerability targets |
| AI frameworks | LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT | Supply chain |
| AI security tools | Garak, PyRIT, Promptfoo | Testing ecosystem |
| AI standards | NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001 | Compliance landscape |
| AI research | Adversarial ML papers, jailbreak repos | Knowledge sources |

*Why prioritize AI?* This is our eventual differentiator. Deep AI coverage establishes expertise.

**Phase 3: Vendor Security Programs (200-500 entities)**

Major vendors and their security infrastructure:

| Category | Examples | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Vendor PSIRTs | Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, Cisco | Advisory sources |
| Bug bounty programs | HackerOne, Bugcrowd hosted programs | Disclosure channels |
| Vendor advisories | MSRC, RHSA, DSA | Enrichment sources |
| Cloud security | AWS Security Hub, Azure Defender | Platform-specific |

*Why vendors?* Vendor advisories are a massive source of vulnerability data that often has richer context than NVD.

**Phase 4: Broader Security Ecosystem (500-1000+ entities)**

Long tail of security knowledge:

| Category | Examples | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Security tools | Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite | Referenced in vulns |
| Security standards | PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2 | Compliance mapping |
| Threat intel | MISP, OpenCTI, threat feeds | Future: threat intelligence |
| Research groups | Google P0, Microsoft MSTIC | Attribution |
| Conferences | DEF CON, Black Hat, RSA | Community nodes |

### What We Learn From Seeding

The act of adding entities teaches us:

**Naming edge cases:**
- What about `AT&T`? → `att` (remove special chars)
- What about `CERT/CC` vs `US-CERT`? → Need aliasing strategy
- What about acquired companies? → Historical entities need tracking

**Relationship patterns:**
- Most vulns have CWE mappings... AI vulns are newer and still being classified
- GHSA cross-references CVE... except for ecosystem-specific issues
- Multiple sources may provide different severity assessments... need reconciliation tracking

**Coverage status:**
- CWE has 4 AI-specific entries (e.g., CWE-1427 for prompt injection), gaps remain
- ATT&CK and ATLAS continue expanding
- AI security taxonomies are still maturing

**Data quality observations:**
- Processing backlogs can delay enrichment data
- Cross-references between databases occasionally need correction
- Different sources may assess severity differently

This learning feeds back into spec refinement and overlay priorities.

| C#/.NET library | Not started | Native .NET support for Windows ecosystem |

### Validation Strategy: AI-Assisted

Registry quality depends on validation. Our approach uses AI as a first-class participant in the validation process.

**The workflow:**

1. **Goal discovery** - Given a SecID like `secid:advisory/redhat/errata#RHSA-2024:1234`, ask AI: "What would you typically want to do with this?" The most likely answer: "Find the URL for this RHSA."

2. **Codify the goal** - That answer becomes the success criterion: resolution must produce a working URL.

3. **Add resolution rules** - Create/update the registry entry with URL templates and patterns.

4. **Verify it works** - AI tests the resolution against real identifiers, confirms URLs resolve.

5. **Iterate** - If edge cases fail, refine the rules.

**Why AI-assisted?**

- **Scale**: 500+ namespaces can't be manually validated continuously
- **Consistency**: AI applies the same verification logic everywhere
- **Discovery**: AI can identify what users would expect before we build it
- **Maintenance**: AI can detect URL rot and resolution failures over time

This isn't "AI does everything" - it's AI as a team member that handles the tedious verification work that humans would skip or do inconsistently.

## Open Questions

Things we'll learn as we build v1.0:

1. **Resolution edge cases**: What happens when a vendor changes their URL structure?
2. **Deprecation**: How do we handle databases that shut down or get acquired?
3. **Search fallback**: When direct URLs aren't possible, what search instructions work best for AI agents?
4. **Update frequency**: How often do registry files need refresh?
5. **Library scope**: Should libraries include validation, or just parsing and resolution?

These will be answered empirically, not theoretically.
