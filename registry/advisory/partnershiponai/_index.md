# Partnership on AI

Partnership on AI is a nonprofit organization bringing together academics, civil society, industry, and media to study and formulate best practices for AI. They operate the AI Incident Database (AIID).

## Why Partnership on AI Matters

Partnership on AI documents real-world AI failures:

- **Historical record** - AI incidents dating back years
- **Pattern recognition** - Identifies recurring failure modes
- **Accountability** - Public record of AI harms
- **Learning** - Helps practitioners avoid past mistakes

The AI Incident Database is broader than pure security - it includes safety, bias, and ethical failures.

## Advisory Sources in This Namespace

| Name | Description | Example ID |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `aiid` | AI Incident Database | 1, 100, 1325 |

## ID Format

AIID uses simple numeric IDs:
```
https://incidentdatabase.ai/cite/1325/
```

Each incident may have multiple reports from different sources describing the same event.

## Scope

AIID covers incidents including:
- Autonomous vehicle accidents
- Facial recognition failures and misidentification
- Content moderation errors
- Algorithmic discrimination
- Healthcare AI mistakes
- Financial AI failures
- LLM misuse and jailbreaks

## Difference from AVID

| AIID | AVID |
|------|------|
| Incidents (what happened) | Vulnerabilities (what could happen) |
| Broader scope (safety, ethics) | Security-focused |
| News/report aggregation | Technical vulnerability details |

## Notes

- Maintained by the Responsible AI Collaborative
- Incidents are submitted by the community
- Useful for AI risk assessment and case studies
- Referenced in AI policy discussions
