# MITRE Corporation

MITRE is a US nonprofit organization that operates federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). In cybersecurity, MITRE is best known for creating and maintaining foundational security frameworks and databases.

## Why MITRE Matters

MITRE created and operates many of the canonical security identifier systems:

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** - The global standard for vulnerability identification
- **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)** - Taxonomy of software/hardware weaknesses
- **ATT&CK** - Framework for adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures
- **CAPEC** - Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification
- **ATLAS** - Adversarial Threat Landscape for AI Systems

When you see a CVE ID, CWE number, or ATT&CK technique - that's MITRE's work.

## Advisory Sources in This Namespace

| Name | Description | Example ID |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `cve` | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures | CVE-2021-44228 |

## Relationship to Other Organizations

- **CISA** contracts MITRE to operate the CVE Program
- **NVD (NIST)** enriches CVE records with CVSS, CPE, CWE data
- **CNAs (CVE Numbering Authorities)** can assign CVE IDs under MITRE's program

## Notes

- MITRE is not a government agency but works closely with US government
- CVE.org is the authoritative source for CVE records
- MITRE also operates other security programs beyond vulnerability management
