# Fortinet

Fortinet is a cybersecurity company specializing in network security appliances, particularly firewalls. FortiGate is one of the most deployed enterprise firewalls globally.

## Why Fortinet Matters for Security

Fortinet devices protect network perimeters:

- **FortiGate** - Next-generation firewall appliances
- **FortiOS** - Operating system for Fortinet devices
- **FortiManager** - Centralized management
- **FortiAnalyzer** - Logging and analytics
- **FortiClient** - Endpoint protection

Fortinet vulnerabilities are high-value targets because firewalls sit at network boundaries with access to internal networks.
