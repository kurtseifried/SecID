  "notes": "MITRE is a US nonprofit that operates federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). In cybersecurity, MITRE created and maintains foundational identifier systems and frameworks: CVE (vulnerability IDs), CWE (weakness taxonomy), ATT&CK (adversary techniques), CAPEC (attack patterns), and ATLAS (AI threat landscape). When you see a CVE ID, CWE number, or ATT&CK technique — that's MITRE's work.\n\nCISA contracts MITRE to operate the CVE Program. NVD (NIST) enriches CVE records with CVSS, CPE, and CWE data. CNAs (CVE Numbering Authorities) can assign CVE IDs under MITRE's program.",
