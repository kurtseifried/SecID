# AIAAIC Repository

The AIAAIC (AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies) Repository is an independent, open database tracking AI-related incidents, controversies, and issues worldwide.

## Why AIAAIC Matters

AIAAIC provides independent incident tracking:

- **Broad scope** - Covers AI, algorithms, and automation issues
- **Independent** - Not affiliated with AI vendors
- **Contextual** - Includes social and ethical dimensions
- **Searchable** - Categorized incident database

## Relationship to Other Databases

| Database | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| AIID (Partnership on AI) | Formal incident reports |
| AIAAIC | Broader controversies and issues |
| OECD AIM | Policy-focused monitoring |
