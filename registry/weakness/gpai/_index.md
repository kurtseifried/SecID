# GPAI (Weakness Namespace)

Risk taxonomies and catalogs specific to general-purpose AI systems, derived from academic research supporting AI governance and standards development.

## Why GPAI Research Matters

General-purpose AI systems (foundation models, large language models) present unique risks that require dedicated taxonomies. Academic research provides neutral, comprehensive catalogs that inform standards and regulations.
