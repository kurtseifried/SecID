NIST produces authoritative security guidance and taxonomies, including AI/ML security frameworks.

## Why NIST Matters for Weaknesses

NIST provides the official US government perspective on security weaknesses:

- **Authoritative** - Federal agency with regulatory influence
- **Research-backed** - Extensive technical research
- **Policy foundation** - Referenced in executive orders and regulations
- **International recognition** - Used globally as reference
