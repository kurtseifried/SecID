# OWASP (Control Namespace)

OWASP produces security controls and verification standards alongside their weakness taxonomies.

## Why OWASP Matters for Controls

OWASP controls bridge the gap between identifying risks and implementing solutions:

- **Practitioner-focused** - Written for developers and security teams
- **Mapped to threats** - Controls linked to specific risks
- **Free and open** - No licensing restrictions
- **Community-driven** - Continuous improvement

## Control Sources in This Namespace

| Name | Description | Example ID |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `asvs` | Application Security Verification Standard | V5.3.4 |
| `ai-exchange` | AI Security Controls | INPUTFILTERING |

## ASVS Overview

The Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) provides:
- Security requirements for web applications
- Three verification levels (L1, L2, L3)
- Testable security controls

## AI Exchange Controls

The AI Exchange provides controls mapped to AI threats:
- Input/output controls
- Model security controls
- Data protection controls

## Relationship to OWASP Top 10 Lists

| Project | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Top 10 / LLM Top 10 | Identify risks (weaknesses) |
| ASVS / AI Exchange | Provide controls (mitigations) |

## Notes

- OWASP spans both weakness and control namespaces
- Controls are designed to address Top 10 risks
- AI Exchange uniquely provides threat-control mapping
